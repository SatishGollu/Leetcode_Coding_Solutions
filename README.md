# Leetcode_Coding_Solutions

This repository includes my solutions to Leetcode algorithm questions. I did not solve randomly,
i solved topic wise and pattern wise. Big thanks to my Mentor [Surya Pratap Kahar](https://www.linkedin.com/in/surya-pratap-kahar/) 
with his help problems are grouped under their respective subtopic, in order to 
focus on applying common patterns and tricks,rather than randomly tackling questions.
