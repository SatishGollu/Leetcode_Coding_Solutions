# Leetcode_Coding_Solutions

This repository includes my solutions to Leetcode algorithm questions. I did not solve randomly,
i solved topic wise and pattern wise.Problems are grouped under their respective subtopic, in order to 
focus on applying common patterns and tricks,rather than randomly tackling questions.
Big thanks to my Mentor [Surya Pratap Kahar](https://www.linkedin.com/in/surya-pratap-kahar/)
